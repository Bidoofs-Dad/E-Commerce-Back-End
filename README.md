# E-Commerce-Back-End


## About The Application

This application is designed to all you to add products, categories and tags to your store's inventory, all through a back end route! It allows you to get all of the data for your tags, products and categories, as well as allows you to create new ones, update existing ones and delete any of them! 

It can be be very handy if you want to keep track of the inventory of whatever you desire!

## Issues

I ran into a few issues when building this, some were solved, some unfortunately remain!

* One issue I had was, the GET route for products by ID wasn't working. Turns out I was just waiting for the wrong data do to copy and pasting from one of my different routes!

* One issue I couldn't get fixed was, when I add Tags to a new product, it doesn't actually reflect properly, it just shows an empty array. This is something I plan on fixing in the future!

* One other issue I ran into is, Insomnia doesn't allow me to delete a category before deleting any products within it. I also plan on fixing this in the future! (I have a feeling I just need to add in an 'ON DELETE CASCADE' somewhere) 

## Screenshots

Below I will include a video of the application working as well as some screenshots!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project wasn't as difficult as I was expecting upon first looking at it! Now if we would've had to code in the whole tag part that was already given to us, that would of been a different story!

I really enjoyed learning more about Models and routes while working through this, it definitely helped me understand them a bit more!
